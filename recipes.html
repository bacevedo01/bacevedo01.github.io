	  		<h1>Easy Lacto-ferment Hot Sauce</h1>
			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>1 cup of hot peppers chopped into rings (about 6 medium size peppers) - You can use any hot pepper you like or mix them up. </li>
				<li>2 garlic cloves, smashed </li>
				<li>1 cup of purified water</li>
				<li>Â½ tablespoon of fine salt (non iodized)</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Do the thing</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Place the hot peppers and garlic cloves in a glass jar. A pint sized mason jar or similar works.</li>
				<li>Make the brine by heating up 1 cup of water and adding the salt.</li>
				<li>Stir the salt until dissolved and let the brine cool to room temperature.</li>
				<li>Once the brine has cooled pour it into the jar with the hot peppers and garlic.</li>
				<li>Cover loosely with a lid and set on the counter in a cool place away from direct sunlight for 2-3 days.</li>
				<li>Stir the brine each day or every two days to prevent mold from forming on the top.</li>
				<li>The brine should become cloudy in 2-3 days depending on the temperature of the room.</li>
				<li>Once it's cloudy and smells slightly sour, place it in a blender and blend until smooth.</li>
				<li>Transfer it to a glass jar and store it in the refrigerator. It's ready to use.</li>
			</ol>
				<b>Lacto-Fermented hot sauce will store for several months.</b>
